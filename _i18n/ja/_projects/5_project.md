## Gene duplication
Evolutionary novelty often necessitates new genetic building blocks, and gene duplication provides it. In many of our projects utilizing genome sequences, we analyze how duplicated genes are associated with evolutionary novelty, such as plant carnivory ([Fukushima et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0059); [Saul et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-023-01563-1)), or with key evolutionary processed, such as gene expression evolution ([Fukushima & Pollock, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18090-8)) and genetic convergence ([Fukushima & Pollock, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01932-7)).

## Whole-genome duplication (WGD)
Genetic duplication events may not always give rise to a single new gene at a time. WGD, which is especially prone in plants, lead to the simultaneous duplication of the entire gene set. The signature of recent and ancient WGDs is often found in newly sequenced genomes, and we extensively characterize its impact. For example, we unexpectedly found that Nepenthes is decaploid, with clear signature of subgenome dominance with recessive subgenomes hosting more specifically expressed genes than expected in the trapping pitchers ([Saul et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-023-01563-1)).

## Gene expression evolution
The change in the site of gene expression is crucial for 

## Genetic convergence


## Preadaptation


## Co-option


## Alternative evolution
Genetic convergence may occur because natural selection permits limited mutational pathways. Alternatively, many mutational pathways may exist, but due to mutational bias, only a few may be followed. To distinguish these possibilities, convergent evolution must be compared with one-time lineage-specific evolution and even zero-time nonhistorical evolution. In this project, we will compare the effects of historical convergence with all alternative possibilities.

## Genetic background
Although a particular genotype may underlie a particular phenotype, the same mutations may also result in distinct phenotypes in different genetic backgrounds. Thus, the effect of genetic background is important for the emergence of genotype-phenotype associations. We will dive into this problem by biochemically characterizing synthesized proteins with 'what-if' sequences with or without lineage-specific mutations.
