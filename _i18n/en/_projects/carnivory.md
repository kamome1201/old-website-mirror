## Genome & transcriptome sequencing
Genomes are massive and scary, but instrumental. We sequence the whole genome of carnivorous plants ([Fukushima et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0059); [Saul et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-023-01563-1)) and others by combining long-read DNA sequencers and Hi-C chromosome conformation capture technology. We often determine the site of gene expression using RNA-seq methods.
