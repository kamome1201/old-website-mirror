## Carnivory
Carnivorous plants are our most favorite organisms to study evolutionary innovations. They attract, trap, and kill prey animals and eventually absorb and reuse degraded nutrients, requiring multiple phenotypes to evolve to be functional. For details, see [here]().

## Other innovative traits
Mainly through collaborations, we participate in the analysis of fascinating traits in both plant and non-plant lineages. Examples include cleistogamy ([Suetsugu et al., 2023](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.18495)) and dioecy ([Saul et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-023-01563-1)).
