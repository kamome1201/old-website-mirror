Our primary focus is on the analysis of carnivorous plants, through which we aim to explore a variety of topics in evolutionary biology. Key areas of research include the followings.

- Phenotypic innovations
- Drastic morphological evolution
- Phenotypic plasticity
- Cell type evolution
- Convergent evolution
- Co-option
- Gene duplication
- Whole-genome duplication
- Gene sequence evolution
- Gene expression evolution
- Gene loss
