In our laboratory, we specialize in solving complex problems by integrating methods from a diverse range of research disciplines. This multidisciplinary approach is tailored for each project we undertake. Specifically, we frequently combine methodologies from the following areas:

- Evolutionary Biology
- Plant Molecular Biology
- Biochemistry
- Genomics
- Bioinformatics
- Phylogenetics
