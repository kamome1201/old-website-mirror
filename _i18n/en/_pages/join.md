### Overview

Our team is continually seeking talented individuals to join us. We are open to applications for positions as postdoctoral fellows or PhD students. Should you be interested in any of these roles, please reach out to Kenji Fukushima for further details.

Our laboratory operates in an English-speaking environment, and we warmly welcome international students and postdoctoral researchers. We are also happy to assist you with your application for fellowships and scholarships.

### Choosing a research topic

The selection of research projects for new members will involve a collaborative process between the candidate and Kenji, taking into account their individual interests and areas of expertise. It is advisable for these projects to align with at least one aspect of Kenji's ongoing research, be it in materials, technology, or specific phenomena. This approach typically proves to be more practical. Nevertheless, we are open to the initiation of entirely new research endeavors. We particularly encourage postdoctoral researchers joining our team to introduce new ideas and perspectives to our lab.

### Joining as a PhD student

At NIG, we provide PhD courses conducted in English. Although NIG primarily functions as a research institute, we are associated with [SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/), which offers an extensive PhD program. We invite prospective PhD students to consider applying through SOKENDAI's program. Our offerings include both 3-year PhD courses (for those with a master's degree) and 5-year courses (for those without a master's). Please note that we generally do not have a program dedicated solely to a master's degree.

For further details, including information on tuition and fellowships, please consult the links provided below. NIG also offers an internship program specifically designed for undergraduate students. If you are interested in this opportunity, we encourage you to contact us for more information.

### Joining as a postdoc

We will advertise postdoctoral positions linked to our lab's research funding through various channels, including the [NIG career page](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/career-development/jobs-at-nig) and [JREC-IN](https://jrecin.jst.go.jp/seek/SeekTop?ln=1).

If you are interested in introducing a new research topic in our lab, we advise to apply for fellowships such as [JSPS Fellowships](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/), [HFSP Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.hfsp.org/) or [NIG Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/career-development/nigpostdoc2024#:~:text=The%20National%20Institute%20of%20Genetics,NIG%20and%20fostering%20researchers%20with). We will provide support during the application process.

Should your research interest coincide with Kenji's areas of interest, there is a possibility for Kenji to seek research funding. However, it is important to note that this process, from initial preparation to acceptance, typically spans over a year.
